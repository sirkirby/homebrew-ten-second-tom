      Voice Entry Setup (Optional):

      For local transcription (privacy-focused, offline):
        1. Install whisper.cpp: brew install whisper-cpp
        2. Download model to default location (base.en, 142 MB):
           mkdir -p ~/.cache/whisper
           curl -L -o ~/.cache/whisper/ggml-base.en.bin \\
             https://huggingface.co/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/resolve/main/ggml-base.en.bin
        3. Done! Tom looks for the model at ~/.cache/whisper/ggml-base.en.bin by default

      OR use OpenAI transcription (requires API key, no local setup):
        tom today --voice --stt=openai
